I'm Erik Perales, a University of Houston graduate with a Bachelor’s in Mathematics and a minor in Data Science. I have experience in data analysis and customer service, with skills in tools like Excel, Python, and PowerBI. Passionate about problem-solving and teamwork, I enjoy discovering trends through data and delivering solutions. When I’m not working, I love capturing moments through photography, gaming, and staying updated with the latest tech. I’m committed to continuous learning and growth in both my personal and professional life."
